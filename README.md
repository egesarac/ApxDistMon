## Approximate Distributed Monitoring (ADM)
Requirements: g++ (version 13.2.0)
Usage: Modify and compile the desired *main_x.cpp* file (where *x* is *rg*, *sd*, or *wt*) using g++.

## Exact Distributed Monitoring (EDM)
Requirements: Python 3 and Z3
Usage: Modify and run the desired *smt_x.py* file (where *x* is *rg_untimed*, *rg_timed*, *sd*, or *wt*) using Python.
